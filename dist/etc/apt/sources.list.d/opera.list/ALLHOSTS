# This file makes sure that Opera Browser is kept up-to-date
# as part of regular system upgrades

# CSG have commented this line out so that Opera is not upgraded
# unexpectedly.  Furthermore, enabling this option can cause delays
# when 'apt-get update' or 'aptitude update' is called.  If you want to
# enable this option, you will need root privileges on your machine:
# 1) ksu to root.
# 2) touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list-special
# 3) uncomment the line below.

# deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free #Opera Browser (final releases)


# The line above will make sure you get all final public releases.
# Uncomment the following line if you want to get alpha and beta
# releases, too.

# CSG: the line below was original commented out.  We have not changed it.
# deb http://deb.opera.com/opera-beta/ stable non-free #Opera Browser (beta releases)
