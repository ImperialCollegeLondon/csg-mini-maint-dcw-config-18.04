I had a dream..

.. but rather sadly, it was about maint:-)

I wondered if one could pull out a small neat non-DoC specific
subset of maint out of the 41000 (!) line behemoth it's become,
and show it to others, talk about it, and use it for DoC purposes
outside of 146.169..  Let's call it "minimaint".

So I thought I'd play...

The core principles must be:

3 components:

- the source code, /sbin/maint, the libraries and all the maint scripts
  (reengineered to have NO DoC specific knowledge in them, no use of
  NFS, rsynclinux.doc.ic.ac.uk, db-admin database etc).  Store this in a
  public git repo..

- DoC specific config information currently embedded in the code, plus
  assumptions like "every hostname is in .doc.ic.ac.uk", per-maint script
  runon and runwhen data, plus per-maint script config data eg. the dist
  tree, the apt package lists, the database config files etc etc.  Store
  this in an /etc/minimaint directory, getting it from a separate git repo,
  not so public, but accessible to DoC machines outside of 146.169:-)

  This directory is one such possible site config dir, and is pushed up to
  the public git repo:
  https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/csg-mini-maint-dcw-config.git

- To replace db-admin, needs more thought, on one level this is more DoC
  specific information, specifically a set of users, groups (and members),
  and hostclasses.  However, this data changes more rapidly than most config
  data (that's why it's in a database:-)).  Perhaps hostclasses could
  permanently leave the database, maybe even users, groups and members.
  I wondered whether all this data could be downloaded in bulk from a
  RESTful API, in JSON format. Alternatively, it could be automatically
  generated (in our case FROM db-admin) as a small number of JSON files
  every N minutes (say once an hour), automatically added to the config repo
  and pushed, making it live.

  For now, this config dir contains a hostclass file containing some made up
  example config info, and now users/site-users.csv and users/site-groups.csv
  files contain all the real DoC users and groups (these are created by the
  generators/mksiteusers and mksitegroups utilities from our database).

The basic idea will be to COPY small bits of maint and it's libraries in
here, separate out the config from the source code, delete as much as
possible, clean and "refactor" it as much as possible.  Let's see what
we come up with.
