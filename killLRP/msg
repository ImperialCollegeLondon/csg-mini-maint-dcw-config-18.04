Dear FIRSTNAME

Your NASTYPROCESS job has been terminated on HOSTNAME because it has
been running for too long.  Here is the "ps aux" format output of the
process we just killed:

PSLINE

Please remember that the shell servers are for remote shell access to
DoC resources like file systems or other batch processors.  If you need
to execute a long running job, please use a more appropriate server,
like one of the batch servers (batch32, batch1) or use the condor
process scheduler.  Information about condor, and about good ways
of running long jobs, are available on the CSG website.

Please let us know if you have any further questions, via email
to doc-help@imperial.ac.uk.

Yours sincerely,
Duncan White, CSG
